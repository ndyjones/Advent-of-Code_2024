# advent of code 2024 solutions

Welcome to my **advent of code 2024** repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨ This project is my attempt to solve the daily programming puzzles provided during the advent of code challenge while learning and improving my python skills. I am a beginner, so this repo is more about practicing and understanding python than showcasing optimized solutions. To that end I am def referencing some previous year solutions and/or/also the evil ai overlords to help me grok stuff like writing more 'pythonic' code. But I am making an effort to logic it all out from the jump.

## about the project

advent of code is an annual event with a series of fun and challenging programming puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th. This repository contains:

- **day-wise folders** (`day1`, `day2`, etc.), each containing:
  - scripts for solving **part 1** and **part 2** of that day's puzzle.
  - a blank `input.txt` file to avoid sharing puzzle inputs as per advent of code's guidelines.

## project structure

```plaintext
.
â”œâ”€â”€ day1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py       # solution for day 1, part 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part2.py       # solution for day 1, part 2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt      # blank file for day 1 input
â”œâ”€â”€ day2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part1.py       # solution for day 2, part 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part2.py       # solution for day 2, part 2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt      # blank file for day 2 input
...
```
Each folder contains:

- part1.py and part2.py: python scripts solving the respective parts of the day's challenge.
- input.txt: a blank file where I run my solutions with the actual input during testing. Inputs are not included to respect advent of code's guidelines.

## acknowledgments
- Thanks to [advent of code](advent of code) for providing such an engaging and educational challenge! let's hope my attention span holds out for a lil bit.
- This repository is inspired by the many pythonistas sharing their learning journey.

## notes
- disclaimer: I am a python newbie, so my solutions may not be the most efficient or elegant. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
- input data: The input.txt files in this repo are blank to keep my puzzle inputs private, as per advent of code's instructions.
